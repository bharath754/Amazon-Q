# PDF Merger

A professional, minimalist web application for merging PDF files, inspired by modern AI presentation tools like Gemini and Gamma.ai.

## Design Philosophy

This application embraces a **minimalist aesthetic** with the following core principles:

### Visual Design
- **Monochromatic Color Palette**: Clean grays with a subtle blue accent (#4299e1) for interactive elements
- **Generous White Space**: Centered layout with ample breathing room around content
- **Card-Based Architecture**: Distinct, elevated containers with soft shadows for visual hierarchy
- **Typography**: Inter font family for clean, modern readability with careful weight and spacing

### User Experience
- **Subtle Animations**: Elegant fade-in and slide-up transitions that enhance without distracting
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Staggered animations reveal content in logical sequence
- **Consistent Interactions**: Unified hover states and micro-interactions throughout
- **Modal-First Approach**: Clean overlay dialogs for secondary content and processes

### Technical Features
- **Client-Side Processing**: All PDF operations happen locally for privacy
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Intuitive file management with visual feedback
- **Real-Time Progress**: Smooth progress indicators during merge operations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences

## Aesthetic Choices

The design draws inspiration from contemporary AI tools, emphasizing:
- **Clarity over complexity**
- **Function over decoration**  
- **Calm, professional atmosphere**
- **Accessibility and usability**

This approach creates a tool that feels both powerful and approachable, suitable for professional use while remaining intuitive for all users.
